# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTOR
 Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting with LSTM Neural Networks in Python

Hello this is my code for predicting stocks using LSTM Neural Networks in Python

The data set can be found using Yahoo Finance

For this particular data set I am using NVDA historical data

Link: https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history?p=NVDA


This is just an example of what it can be used for.

It utilises LTSM nodes to predict stock prices based on historical datasets 

The model will be split into three partitions 

Training will train the model

Validation will help train the model

Testing will be used to evaluate the model
